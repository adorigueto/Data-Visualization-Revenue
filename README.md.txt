#### THis is a script for revenue visual analysis. The initial table contains a field of date, revenue and revenue type. The data was randomly generated (the code used to do it is on the folder).

## Methodology
### Three methodologies were used to visualize the revenue
#### 1. revenue_viz_01.r: Using two revenue fields separately
#### 2. revenue_viz_01.r: Using only one revenue and the type field to differ both revenues in the graph AND Using ggplot2
#### 3. revenue_viz_01.r: Using only one revenue and the type field to differ both revenues in the graph AND Using Plotly
