# revenue_viz
Visualization of economic and financial revenue.

## Data
The initial data table contains a field of date, revenue and revenue type. The data was randomly generated (see file generate_random_income_and_dates.R).

## Methodology
Three methodologies were used to visualize the revenue
1st Methodology: Using two revenue fields separately
      Files: revenue_viz_01.R, revenue.csv
      Plot engine: ggplot2

2nd Methodology: Using only one revenue and the type field to differ both revenues in the graph
      Files: revenue_viz_02.R, revenue_with_type.csv
      Plot engine: ggplot2

3rd Methodology: Using only one revenue and the type field to differ both revenues in the graph
      Files: revenue_viz_02.R, revenue_with_type.csv
      Plot engine: Plotly
